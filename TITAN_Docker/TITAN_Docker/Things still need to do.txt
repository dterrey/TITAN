Things still need to do.

1. change the TITAN Upload page to use titan_processor and that it watches that folder and when a file or artifact is uploaded.

2. Add the TITAN containers flow so when I upload 5 examples, it round robins across 5 containers and each one processers from the one folder.

3. Make sure it all works bit by bit.
